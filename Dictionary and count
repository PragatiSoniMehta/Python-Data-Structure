9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent  the greatest number of mail messages.  The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.  The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.  After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

Solution:
name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
emailids = list()
Emailct = dict()
for lines in handle:    
    lines.strip()    
    if lines.startswith('From '):        
        lines.rstrip()        
        words = lines.split()        
        emailid = words[1]        
        emailids.append(words[1])      
for id in emailids:    
    Emailct[id] = Emailct.get(id,0) + 1

Greatword = None
Greatest = None

for key,value in Emailct.items():    
    if Greatest is None or Greatest < value:        
    Greatest = value        
    Greatword = key

print Greatword,Greatest
